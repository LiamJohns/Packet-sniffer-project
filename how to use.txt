Notes:

When you click the "End tutorial" button on the tutorial page it doesnt currently send you to the main sniffing window so you will need to click on the back button found at the top left side of the window to go back to the landing page.
You will then click enter click "No" for the tutorial and you will then be taken to the sniffer window.
